    "description": "Determine the thermodynamic properties for nucleotide conversions. Nucleotides are 5'-phosphates of nucleosides, and are known to interact with Mg2+ ions. Experiments regarding the equilibrium constant of reactions, e.g. of the 'kinase' reaction (i.e. phosphorylation of a nucleoside to a nucleotide), need to take this and other interaction factors into account (e.g. scan this) to generate valuable results.",
